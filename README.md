# MAL(My Anime List)

This project was loosely based on MAL (https://myanimelist.net) which is an anime and manga social networking and social cataloging application website run by volunteers. The site provides its users with a list-like system to organize and score anime and manga.

## Technologies used
- REACT JS
- NODE JS
- Material UI 


## Things to Imrpove on
With this being my very first fullstack project this was quite the hurdle, 

- Make the data from the backEnd reach the frontEnd to display on the page

- Make the removeFromFavorites reach the backEnd

- Add another functionality that allows the user to write their own review
